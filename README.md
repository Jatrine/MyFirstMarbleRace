# MyFirstMarbleRace

Being an audience of Marble Race videos for so long, finally I made up my mind to set up my own Unity implementation. As a beginning, in this practice I'll build a simple version with very basic mechanisms, and then compare with [this YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eE67fk5X4U&t=62s) to see where I can do better. Wish me best luck!
